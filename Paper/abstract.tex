Manually creating many problems that involve specific concepts or skills is often a tedious task for a teacher. We present a system based on 

on the Sketch synthesis tool for automatically generating Python programming problems. We first model targeted programming constructs provided by the user as a subset of Python Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in Sketch using Abstract Data Types (ADTs). We then generate the program along with input/output examples that describe the program. A problem can then be presented to the user as a partially complete program with input/output examples as constraints. We are currently able to generate a simple set of Python problems and are working to extend our grammar to synthesize more complex programs.
