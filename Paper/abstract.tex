The ability to automate problem generation to cater to the practice needs of different students presents a problem in large scale courses. In this work we present a constraint-based system to automatically generate programming problems that engage the user in practicing specific concepts. Using constraints, this system can capture the notion of problem difficulty and targeted concepts.. We apply our general technique to generate fill-in-the-blank Python programming problems and math problems in two domains: analytic geometry and calculus.
